# Final project

### Business Problem Context

Congratulations! You have just been hired as a Data Scientist at the company
Fome Zero, and his main task at the moment is to help CEO Kleiton Guerra
identify key points of the company, answering the questions he asks
using data!
The company Fome Zero is a restaurant marketplace. That is, your core
business is to facilitate the meeting and negotiations of customers and restaurants. You
restaurants register within the Zero Hunger platform, which makes available
information such as address, type of cuisine served, if you have reservations, if you do
deliveries and also an evaluation note of the restaurant's services and products,
among other information.

### The challenge

CEO Guerra was also recently hired and needs to understand the business better
to be able to make the best strategic decisions and further leverage the
Zero Hunger, and for that, he needs an analysis of the data from the
company and that dashboards are generated, based on these analyses, to answer
the questions you can find in [Project](https://github.com/marcelorissids/ftc_pa/blob/main/projeto_final.pdf).
